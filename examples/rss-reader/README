RSS reader application
======================

Example of an application using the tracker SparQL interface to query
data and set other data.

To simulate the incoming of new RSS entries, there is a helper utility
to generate a random RSS Message and saving it into tracker.


The programs
============

./main.py : A tree view that loads the data from tracker. It connects
to the signal "Change in RSS Messages", so can act to it.

./signaller.py: Small app that generates a random post and insert it
into tracker (using the sparql interface).

**** The feed channel "planet-maemo" need to be registered in tracker
     before using signaller. So the first time you initialize tracker
     with -r or remove the DBs, you need to load the file
     initial-data.ttl. For instance with this command:

dbus-send --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.Tracker3 /org/freedesktop/Tracker3/Resources org.freedesktop.Tracker3.Resources.Load string:"/x/y/z/initial-data.ttl"

or more easily:

tracker-import /x/y/z/initial-data.ttl
