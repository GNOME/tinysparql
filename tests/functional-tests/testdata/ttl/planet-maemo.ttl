This is especially handy when browsing UPnP/DLNA servers.<br /><br /><img src="http://mediabox.garage.maemo.org/sshots/mediabox-video.png" /><br /><br />The mplayer backend has been optimized and mplayer now plays videos generally a lot smoother than before. Playback of higher resolution videos (e.g. 640 x 480) is now also smoother by automatic downscaling.<br /><br />Media indexing has been improved and runs faster. And if you don\'t like indexing of ID tags, you can always browse the filesystem to play your media, of course.<br /><br /><img src="http://mediabox.garage.maemo.org/sshots/mediabox-browse-by-genre.png" /><br /><br />Music can now also be browsed by genre, additional to browsing by artist, by album, and by folder.<br /><br /><img src="http://mediabox.garage.maemo.org/sshots/mediabox-display-light.png" /><br /><br />MediaBox can now be told to keep the display lit while playing media. Stop playing, and the device may enter powersaving mode again.<br /><br />If you use the Nokia headset that came with the device, you can now use the headset button to pause/play and skip to the next or previous track. Do this by pushing the button once, twice, or three times, respectively. Do not press the button to quickly because the headset is bad at detecting consecutive actions, though.

I was totally hooked on to it. After going through its hilarious tutorial and starting with a pathetic performance, I managed to score 37K points with 87% accuracy on the "Defy the Machine" song a few moments ago.<br /><br />Couple days ago Nokia released the alpha version of Maemo 5 SDK (Fremantle) too.<br /><br />I woke up next morning with an inevitable thought of porting the former on the later.<br /><br />After a day\'s work here is a video demo of "Frets on Fire" running in the Maemo scratchbox SDK. And find below a list of things I had to do to get it working.<br /><br />[If you don\'t know about FoF, it\'s an open source Guitar Hero clone that runs on many desktop platforms. It is written completely in python. While playing it you hold your keyboard in an unusual fashion so that it simulates a rockstar\'s guitar. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frets_on_fire">wikipedia</a>)]<br /><br /><br /><br />In future we can tweak FoF\'s UI so that the strings could be pressed against the frets using the touch screen itself.<br /><br />There is no sound in the video, but it\'s just because I couldn\'t channel the sound through two layers of virtualization and into the video recorder software. I could hear the songs alright though after transporting them over wire using pulseaudio.<br /><br />[Note that scratchbox is running on Ubuntu which itself is a KVM virtual machine. That should put the poor framerate into perspective.]<br /><br />Here are the things I had to do:<br /><ul><li>Fremantle SDK doesn\'t have python distutils. In diablo it comes from extras repo, so I borrowed it from there as well. (Added diablo extras repo in /etc/apt/sources.list)<br /></li><li>Fremantle SDK has a bug that I had <a href="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/maemo/developers/44229#44229">discussed</a> on mailing list during pre-alpha release, due to which the SDL/pygame applications cannot use the OpenGL support of the SDK. Due to same bug, FoF would also not work.
