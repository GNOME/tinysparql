tracker-export(1)
=================

== NAME

tracker-export - Export all data from a Tracker database.

== SYNOPSIS

*tracker export* [_options_...]

== DESCRIPTION

*tracker export* exports all data stored in a Tracker database, in
Turtle format.

The output is intended to be machine-readable, not human readable. Use a
tool such as rapper(1) to convert the data to different formats.

== OPTIONS

*-g, --show-graphs*::
  Tracker can separate data into multiple graphs. This feature is used
  by the filesystem miner to separate different types of content. This
  flag causes the releveant GRAPH statements to be output along with
  the data.

  In this mode the output is TriG syntax rather than Turtle, due to
  the extra GRAPH statements. Some tools which understand Turtle do not
  understand TriG.

== EXAMPLES

Export all data from Tracker Index and prettify the output using
rapper(1).::

....
$ tracker export -b org.freedesktop.Tracker1.Miner.Files | rapper - -I . -i turtle -o turtle
....
