tracker-sql(1)
==============

== NAME

tracker-sql - Use SQL to query the Tracker databases.

== SYNOPSIS

....
tracker sql -q <sql> | -f <file>
....

== DESCRIPTION

This command allows probing of the current database. When using commands
like *tracker sparql*, the SPARQL used is translated into SQL before
being run on the database. This allows direct use of the database using
SQL avoiding the SPARQL engine entirely.

The caller can run a query two ways, either by providing a _file_ with
the query or by providing a string with the _sql_ query.

The _file_ argument can be either a local path or a URI. It also does
not have to be an absolute path.

== OPTIONS

*-f, --file=<__file__>*::
  Use a _file_ with SPARQL content to query. Don't forget to end all
  queries with a semicolon (;) and also to use quotes around table
  names. The quotes are important because most tables are named after
  ontology classes like "nfo:Document" and queries will fail without the
  quotes.
*-q, --query=<__sql__>*::
  Use a _sql_ string to query the database with.

== EXAMPLES

Show first 10 "nfo:Document" entries where the TOC is not NULL::
+
----
$ tracker sql -q 'SELECT * FROM "nfo:Document" WHERE "nfo:tableOfContents" NOT NULL LIMIT 10;'
----
