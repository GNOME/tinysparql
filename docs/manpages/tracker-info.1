.TH tracker-info 1 "Oct 2008" GNU "User Commands"

.SH NAME
tracker-info \- Retrieve all information available for a certain file.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtracker info\fR [\fIoptions\fR...] <\fIfile1\fR> [[\fIfile2\fR] ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tracker info
asks for all the known metadata available for the given \fIfile\fR.

Multiple \fIfile\fR arguments can be provided to retrieve information
about multiple files.

The \fIfile\fR argument can be either a local path or a URI. It also
does not have to be an absolute path.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-full\-namespaces
By default, all keys and values reported about any given \fIfile\fR
are returned in shortened form, for example, \fInie:title\fR is shown
instead of
\fIhttp://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/01/19/nie#title\fR.
This makes things much easier to see generally and the output is less
cluttered. This option reverses that so FULL namespaces are shown
instead.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-plain\-text\-content
If the resource being displayed has nie:PlainTextContent (i.e.
information about the content of the resource, which could be the
contents of a file on the disk), then this option displays that in the
output.
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-resource\-is\-iri
In most cases, the \fIfile\fR argument supplied points to a URL or
PATH which is queried for according to the resource associated with it
by \fInie:url\fR. However, in cases where the \fIfile\fR specified
turns out to be the actual URN itself, this argument is required to
tell "tracker info" not to do the extra step of looking up the URN
related by \fInie:url\fR.

For example, consider that you store URNs by the actual URL itself and
use the unique nie:url in another resource (which is quite reasonable
when using containers and multi-resource conditions), you would need
this argument to tell "tracker info" that the \fIfile\fR supplied
is actually a URN not URL.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-turtle
Output results as Turtle RDF. If \-f is enabled, full URIs are shown
for subjects, predicates and objects; otherwise, shortened URIs are
used, and all the prefixes Tracker knows about are printed at the top
of the output.
