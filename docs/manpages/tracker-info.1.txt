tracker-info(1)
===============

== NAME

tracker-info - Retrieve all information available for a certain file.

== SYNOPSIS

*tracker info* [_options_...] <__file1__> [[_file2_] ...]

== DESCRIPTION

*tracker info* asks for all the known metadata available for the given
_file_.

Multiple _file_ arguments can be provided to retrieve information about
multiple files.

The _file_ argument can be either a local path or a URI. It also does
not have to be an absolute path.

== OPTIONS

*-f, --full-namespaces*::
  By default, all keys and values reported about any given _file_ are
  returned in shortened form, for example, _nie:title_ is shown instead
  of _http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/01/19/nie#title_.
  This makes things much easier to see generally and the output is less
  cluttered. This option reverses that so FULL namespaces are shown
  instead.
*-c, --plain-text-content*::
  If the resource being displayed has nie:PlainTextContent (i.e.
  information about the content of the resource, which could be the
  contents of a file on the disk), then this option displays that in the
  output.
*-i, --resource-is-iri*::
  In most cases, the _file_ argument supplied points to a URL or PATH
  which is queried for according to the resource associated with it by
  _nie:url_. However, in cases where the _file_ specified turns out to
  be the actual URN itself, this argument is required to tell "tracker
  info" not to do the extra step of looking up the URN related by
  _nie:url_.

For example, consider that you store URNs by the actual URL itself and
use the unique nie:url in another resource (which is quite reasonable
when using containers and multi-resource conditions), you would need
this argument to tell "tracker info" that the _file_ supplied is
actually a URN not URL.

*-t, --turtle*::
  Output results as Turtle RDF. If -f is enabled, full URIs are shown
  for subjects, predicates and objects; otherwise, shortened URIs are
  used, and all the prefixes Tracker knows about are printed at the top
  of the output.
