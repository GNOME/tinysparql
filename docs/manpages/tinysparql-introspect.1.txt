== DESCRIPTION

This command allows probing of the current database schema (also known
as ontology) and endpoint capabilities. If called with no additional
arguments to the one specifying the database connection, all information
is extracted.

In terms of the database ontology, it's easy to find out what properties
are indexed for speed, or notified on changes, what classes are
available and the properties belonging to those classes. There are also
visual tools to display an ascii tree layout of the classes and their
relationships to each other.

== OPTIONS
*-b, --dbus-service=<__service_name__>*::
  Connects to a SPARQL endpoint at a D-Bus name.
*-d, --database-path=<__database_path__>*::
  Connects to a database by location in the filesystem.
*-r, --remote-service=<__url__>*::
  Connects to a HTTP SPARQL endpoint.

*-c, --list-classes*::
  Returns a list of classes which describe the ontology used for storing
  data. These classes are also used in queries. For example,
  _http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Resource_ is one of many classes
  which should be returned here.
*-x, --list-class-prefixes*::
  Returns a list of prefixes in shortened and long form. All RDF classes
  and properties have such a prefix that may be expressed in either form.
*-p, --list-properties=[_class_]*::
  Returns a list of properties which pertain to a _class_. You can use
  both formats here for the _class_, either the full name
  _http://tracker.api.gnome.org/ontology/v3/nfo#Video_ or
  the shortened prefix name _nfo:Video_. See also *--tree* and *--query*.

*-n, --list-notifies=[_class_]*::
  Returns a list of classes which are notified over D-Bus about any
  changes that occur in the database. The _class_ does not have to be
  supplied here. This is optional and filters the results according to
  any argument supplied. With no _class_, all classes are listed.

*-i, --list-indexes=[_property_]*::
  Returns a list of properties which are indexed in the database.
  Indexes improves query speed but also add an indexing penalty. The
  _property_ does not have to be supplied here. This is optional and
  filters the results according to any argument supplied. With no
  _property_, all properties are listed.
*-g, --list-graphs*::
  List all the named graphs in the database. These are used by the
  filesystem miner to separate metadata so that apps can only see
  the information relevant to them.
*-t, --tree=[_class_]*::
  Prints a tree showing all parent classes of _class_ in the ontology.
  The _class_ can be provided in shorthand or longhand (see
  *--get-shorthand* and *--get-longhand* for details).

If no _class_ is given, the entire tree is shown.

The *--search* command line option can be used to highlight parts of the
tree you're looking for. The search is case insensitive.

The *--properties* command line option can be used to show properties
for each class displayed

*-s, --search=<__needle__>*::
  Returns a list of classes and properties which partially match
  _needle_ in the ontology. Search is case insensitive. See also *--tree*.
