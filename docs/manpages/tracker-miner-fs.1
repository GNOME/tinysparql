.SH NAME
tracker-miner-fs \- Used to crawl the file system to mine data.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtracker-miner-fs\fR [\fIOPTION\fR...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tracker-miner-fs
is not supposed to be run by the user since it is started by
its .desktop file when the user logs in. It can also be started
manually of course for debugging purposes. You can not run more than
one instance of this at the same time.

.B tracker-miner-fs
mines information about applications and files only.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-?, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Returns the version of this binary.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbosity={0|1|2|3}
Sets the logging level, 0=errors, 1=minimal, 2=detailed, 3=debug.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-initial-sleep=SECONDS
Sets the initial sleep time before crawling the file system is
started. If the
.B \-\-no-daemon
option is used, this option is ignored.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-no-daemon
Tells the miner to exit once all indexing has finished and the
database is up to date. This is not the default mode of operation for
the miner, usually it stays around acting like a daemon to monitor
file updates which may occur over time. This option renders the
.B \-\-initial-sleep
option moot.
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-eligible=FILE
Checks if 
.B FILE 
is eligible for being mined based on the current
configuration rules. In addition to this, it will check if 
.B FILE
would be monitored for changes. This works with non-existing 
.B FILE
arguments as well as existing 
.B FILE
arguments.
