# Ontologies

Ontologies define the structure of the data that the triplestore
can hold. It defines the possible resource classes,
the properties these classes may have, and the relation between
the different classes as expressed by these properties.

Tracker defines stock ontologies that are ready for use, but
also allows developers to define ontologies that are tailored
for their use.
