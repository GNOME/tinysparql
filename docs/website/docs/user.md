# User Documentation

Tracker is a system component and most users will not need to interact with
it directly.

GNOME has documentation on how to
[search for files in the file manager](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/unstable/files-search.html.en).

The `tracker3` commandline tool provides direct access to Tracker, and you
can [read the documentation online](../commandline/).
