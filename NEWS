Translations: ca, cs, da, kk, lt, pt_BR, sv, zh_TW

  Highlighted changes since 2.1.x:
  --------------------------------

  * New SPARQL parser, able to generate SQL that is generally more readable
    and at places performs better. Multiple buglets fixed in the process
  * Much improved support of SPARQL1.1 features and syntax that was missing:
    - Property paths: Allowing to match connectivity between two resources
      by an arbitrary length path. There is a number of supported operators
      (alternative, sequence, oneOrMany, ...) that can be combined, e.g:

      SELECT ?s ?p { ?s ^(nfo:belongsToContainer*)/(nie:url|nie:title) ?p }

      Only the negated path operator (!) is not supported at the moment.

    - Support for fully unrestricted queries, eg:

      SELECT ?s ?p ?o { ?s ?p ?o } ORDER BY ?o ?p ?s

      Queries with unrestricted predicate (?p in the example above) were
      just supported in a very restricted set of situations. All those
      limitations are gone.
    - MINUS allows subtracting the solutions that match the given triples
      template, eg:

      SELECT ?s { ?s a nfo:Media } MINUS { ?s a nfo:MusicPiece }

  * Support for prepared statements. TrackerSparqlStatement can be built
    with SELECT queries containing (custom) ~var syntax, and updating
    their values before obtaining a cursor.
  * Many tests were added, and Tracker is generally much better tested thanks
    to CI.
  * tracker-store now automatically shuts down on inactivity.

  NOTE TO PACKAGERS: This release might trigger ABI checks, as
    TrackerSparqlConnectionClass struct size grew. This object can only
    be subclassed within Tracker and instantiated through Tracker API, so
    the change is inconsequential.

NEW in 2.2.0-alpha2 - 2019-02-06
================================

  * More property paths supported, new operators supported are *, +, ? and |,
    only the ! operator is not supported yet.
  * Multiple fixes to the new sparql parser.
  * Improve error handling in DBus backend
  * Many improvements and additions to the test suite
  * Fixed potential crash in TrackerMonitor.

Translations: el, es, fur, fr, gl, id, pl, ro, sl, sv, tr

NEW in 2.2.0-alpha1 - 2018-11-13
================================

  * New SPARQL parser, able to support more 1.1 features and generating
    friendlier SQL at places. There is initial support for property
    paths (/ and ^), and other missing 1.1 syntax (MINUS, SHA384, ...).
    More improvements are expected to happen in the future thanks to this.
  * Support for prepared statements. TrackerSparqlStatement can be built
    with SELECT queries containing (custom) ~var syntax, and updating
    their values before obtaining a cursor.
  * Added global libtracker-sparql call to change the used DBus connection
    at runtime.
  * Made tracker-store to automatically shutdown when unneeded.

=========================

  * Brown paper bag release
  * All features from unreleased 2.0.5 apply
  * One feature was missed: TrackerResource is now able to output
    JSON-LD. This is a new API call, so a minor bump should happen

  Translations: ca, da, eu, fi, fur, it, ko, lt, lv, nl, pt_BR, sk, sv, zh_TW

  Overview of changes since 1.12:

  * Tracker core (store, libraries) and miners have been split, this source
    tree contains the former.
  * Added support for domain ontologies, these can be used to set up private
    databases managed and populated by a standalone set of daemons. It was
    devised for sandboxing environments like Flatpak, but can be used
    independently.
  * Added API to manage application-private databases with (optional) custom
    ontologies. The application is in charge of content population as well as
    queries.
    No daemons are required for this usecase, so this becomes a SPARQL
    endpoint equivalent to SQLite.
  * libtracker-miner objects can now be used on the application side in
    combination with application-private endpoints. An additional object
    has been added to make TrackerMiner implementations exported through
    DBus.
  * The filesystem TrackerMiner base implementation has received some
    notable speedups.
  * Running multiple concurrent SELECT queries is now lock-free on most
    situations.
  * Meson build instructions have been added.

NEW in 1.99.3 - 2017-08-22
==========================

  WARNING: This is unstable development towards 2.0. There are API and
           ABI incompatibilities that might affect you.

  * Mandate that SQLite >= 3.20.0 must have --enable-fts5. SQLite devs
    made forwards and backwards incompatible changes to the FTS5 module,
    it is not sustainable anymore to ship a FTS5 module for all
    combinations. The current FTS5 module in Tracker is preserved for
    older SQLite versions.
  * Fixed a Coverity warning (CID #1453480)
  * Misc code and build fixes.

Translations: fr, gl, ml, ne, pl, sr, sr@latin

NEW in 1.99.2 - 2017-08-07
==========================

  WARNING: This is unstable development towards 2.0. There are API and
           ABI incompatibilities that might affect you.

  * Miners have been split from the Tracker package, they can be found
    at https://git.gnome.org/browse/tracker-miners.
  * Sqlite 3.20 introduced incompatible changes in the way FTS5 can be
    extended, compile/runtime checks were added to adapt to the new
    safer way if Sqlite >= 3.20.0 is found.
  * Elements are no longer leaked in the base Resource table. A refcounted
    approach ensures no longer needed elements are cleaned up from that
    table. The database will no longer indefinitely grow, it will be
    cleaned up and vacuumed periodically.
  * Fixed several Coverity warnings (CIDS: 1452447, 1188417, 1188418,
    1188428, 1452443, 1452445, 1452449)
  * Misc code and build fixes.
  * Documentation improvements

NEW in 1.99.1 - 2017-07-19
==========================

  WARNING: This is unstable development towards 2.0. There are API and
           ABI incompatibilities that might affect you.

  * Notable speedups to tracker-miner-fs, main loop overhead was greatly
    reduced by processing elements in batches. Indexing has been observed
    to be up to 2x faster, and startup on an indexed and up-to-date
    filesystem up to 3x.
  * More notable speedups to tracker-miner-fs startup, this applies only
    to filesystems where the number of indexed folders exceed the amount
    of inotify handles. Inotify monitoring is temporarily disabled during
    filesystem mtime checks, resulting in up to 4x faster startup. (In
    addition to the previous point).
  * Refurbished the allocation scheme for underlying DB interfaces. The
    benefit is twofold, this makes TrackerSparqlConnections truly isolated
    instances, and results in much reduced mutex contention on stress
    situations.
  * Dropped deprecated API to get direct/bus connections. Use
    tracker_sparql_connection_get().
  * Deprecated TrackerSparqlBuilder. Use TrackerResource.
  * Added tracker_sparql_connection_get_namespace_manager() to fetch the
    namespaces as per the ontology of the connection.
  * Dropped support for non-standard SPARQL syntax "AS var", the right
    syntax is "AS ?var", defined in SPARQL1.1 and accepted by Tracker
    for a long time.
  * Added tracker:title-order() sparql function, only meant to be used
    in "ORDER BY" clauses. It drops the common articles at the beginning
    of the given variable for sorting purposes.
  * Fix shutdown issues on tracker-store introduced in 1.99.0. No more
    spurious integrity checks on startup.
  * Misc code and build fixes.

NEW in 1.99.0 - 2017-07-06
==========================

  WARNING: This is unstable development towards 2.0. There are API and
           ABI incompatibilities that might affect you.

  * Domain ontologies: it is now possible to create domain-specific SPARQL
    endpoints with customizable ontologies and data locations. It is possible
    to do so either in-process using the traditional Tracker daemons to
    do the work (Note: miners rely on Nepomuk ontology).
  * Deleted nautilus/firefox/evolution/thunderbird plugins. They were in
    a pitiful state of maintainership, the latter 2 being known broken for
    some time already.
  * Deleted tracker-needle. It has been in strict maintenance state for years,
    since then other UIs have integrated Tracker search and offer a more
    compelling and modern experience.
  * Deleted tracker-preferences. Tracker has been using GSettings for years,
    so doesn't specifically require an UI for it, there's of course room
    for desktop integrated configuration, gnome-control-center does this
    for example.
  * Made portions of libtracker-miner useful on the client side. Miners don't
    mandate anymore an org.freedesktop.Tracker1.Miner DBus interface/name,
    this is instead delegated on TrackerMinerProxy. TrackerMinerFS has been
    made largely independent of the ontology in use, all high level operations
    that do require SPARQL updates are now exposed in TrackerMinerFSClass.
  * Removed deprecated and duplicate API on libtracker-miner
  * Added documentation about creating and maintaining ontologies.
  * Removed maemo leftovers.
  * libtracker-sparql: Protect sqlite3_bind* with interface lock
  * Improvements to meson build

NEW in 1.8.0 - 2016-03-21
=========================

Changes since 1.7.5:
  * libtracker-miner: Adapt to libcue 2.0
  * translations: da

Overview of changes since 1.6.x:
  * Better support of the Sparql 1.1 syntax:
    - Support for many builtin functions:
      * String: CONCAT, CONTAINS, LCASE, UCASE, STRLEN, SUBSTR, STRSTARTS, STRENDS,
        STRBEFORE, STRAFTER, ENCODE_FOR_URI.
      * Numeric: ABS, ROUND, CEIL, FLOOR, RAND.
      * Date/Time: YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTES, SECONDS, NOW.
      * Checksum: MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512.
  * Support for Sparql 1.1's DELETE {} INSERT {} WHERE {} syntax. This allows for
    performing complex updates in a single operation, without the shortcomings of
    the tracker specific INSERT OR REPLACE {} syntax.
  * Support for Sparql 1.1's BIND(). This allows mapping complex evaluations to a
    variable within the triple pattern, so usable within it.
  * The latter two applied allowed tracker-miner-fs to halve the time spent in
    handling move operations.
  * Many fixes to tracker-miner-fs and libtracker-miner, it is now a lot more robust
    esp. around cancellation situations (eg. deleting/unmounting the folder currently
    being indexed).
  * Many fixes to tracker-extract modules, many consistency fixes have been fixed where
    modules would produce invalid Sparql (eg. breaking cardinality limits of certain
    variables) if given files with unexpected metadata.
  * As a result of the last two points, 1.8.0 fixes most of the warnings/criticals that
    have been reported as "spamming journald".
  * Tracker now uses GTask, except for vala code.

=========================

The main changes since 1.2.x are:

  * build: Require GLib >= 2.4.0, for g_str_match_string() and g_info()
  * all: Migrate to GKeyfileSettingsBackend, including:
   * Now when using TRACKER_USE_CONFIG_FILES env var, we use this backend
   * MAN pages which previously didn't exist for configurations are generated from xml gschemas
  * libstemmer: Removed imported code and depend on external version
  * libtracker-miner: Major update to Vala bindings
  * libtracker-common: Major clean up and removal of unused internal APIs, including:
    * Removed os-dependent APIs (mainly process spawning GLib does now anyway)
    * Removed tracker_file_(un)lock() API which was unused
    * Removed all run-time locale management, GNOME handles this between logins, so do we
    * Removed TrackerConfigFile and TrackerKeyfileObject classes, use GSettings instead
    * Removed unused type utils functions (e.g. tracker_*_to_string() and more)
    * Moved tracker-ontologies.h (with prefix, etc definitions) into libtracker-sparql
    * Moved CRC32 API into libtracker-data (the only place it's used)
    * Moved TrackerStorage class to tracker-miner-fs (only place it's used)

    * .pc: Pkgconfig files (moved from data/ into src/libtracker-miner, etc)
    * .service: DBus files (moved from data/dbus/* to src/tracker-store, etc)
    * .png, .svg: Moved artwork into src/tracker-needle)
    * .gschema.xml: GSettings files (moved from data/gschemas into src, tracker-store, etc)

NEW in 1.2.0 - 2014-09-22
=========================

The main changes since 1.0.x are:

  * New Feature: Extractor now supports eBook and Comic book formats
  * New Feature: Extractor now supports BMP files
  * New Feature: Data Provider: Now there are TrackerDataProvider and TrackerEnumerator interfaces to allow 3rd parties to supply their own data to Tracker to be indexed, for example for an online or proprietary service
  * New Feature: Extractor is now 'crash-aware' that being, we have a separate data source for content that can't be extracted to avoid repeated failures from tracker-extract. This also survives through crashes that may occur due to attempted extractions
  * build: Updated doap file (added programming language and category is now "core")
  * build: Improve firefox and thunderbird detection to avoid warnings in console
  * build: Removed all GNU_SOURCE additions in sources, use AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS instead
  * build: Fixed many unit tests that were not properly isolated
  * build: configure now has an --enable-minimal option to ONLY build tracker-store
  * build: Reduce vala generated source warnings from GCC

  * build: Require libicu >= 4.8.1.1, first version with pkg-config support, no version specified before
  * build: Require Vala >= 0.18.0 (was 0.16.0) to avoid Vala 0.16 g_dbus_message_get_body() binding bug
  * build: Require GLib >= 2.38 (was 2.35.1) after removing all deprecated g_test_trap_fork() calls for _subprocess()

  * New Feature: SPARQL functions tracker:normalize() and tracker:unaccent()
  * New Feature: libav extractor for extracting audio/video metadata
  * New Feature: tracker-store GraphUpdated signal delay now configurable: This signal is what's used to notify of resource changes in the database (e.g. new file added), previously it was always 1 second, now it can be configured

NEW in 0.17.1 - 2014-01-24

The main changes are:

  * build: Require Vala >= 0.18.0 (was 0.16.0) to avoid Vala 0.16 g_dbus_message_get_body() binding bug
  * build: Require GLib >= 2.38 (was 2.35.1) after removing all deprecated g_test_trap_fork() calls for _subprocess()
  * build: Require libosinfo >= 0.2.9 (was 0.0.2)
  * build: Use gtkdocize in autogen.sh differently to avoid "-chmod command not found", see GB#701259
  * build: Remove ALL GLib marshallers. We depend on GLib (>= 2.30) which depends on libffi enabling us to do this
  * build: Add SQLite 3.8.1 to list of bad SQLite versions
  * New Feature: Passive extraction:
                 Specific metadata extraction (e.g. image orientation)
                 is done by listening for insert signals for resource metadata
                 (e.g. file name, size, etc) and done passively rather than being
                 required before inserting ANY information about a resource
                 This officially makes tracker-extract a miner of special sorts
  * New Feature: SPARQL functions tracker:normalize() and tracker:unaccent()
  * New Feature: libav extractor for extracting audio/video metadata
  * New Feature: tracker-store GraphUpdated signal delay now configurable:
                 This signal is what's used to notify of resource changes in the database (e.g. new file added),
                 Previously it was always 1 second, now it can be configured
  * Fixes: GB#721880, fts:offsets returns wrong values

  * Fixes: RH#1026283, Nautilus eating 100% cpu
  * libtracker-common: Added strnlen() compatibility function
  * libtracker-common: Fixed unit test for SCHED_IDLE expecting SCHED_OTHER by default, but jhbuild uses SCHED_IDLE as standard.
  * libtracker-fts: Strengthen against SQLite failures. Ensure no infinite loos in sqlite3_step() and don't use g_once_init_enter() for init
  * tracker-extract: Support Qt5
  * tracker-extract: Removed --disable-shutdown command line option now that it is instantiated by DBus
  * tracker-extract: Fixed memory leak with strings processed detected as UTF16
  * tracker-extract: msoffice: Fixed memory leak, calling g_free() on wrong pointer

  * tracker-extract: gstreamer: Fixed memory leak on error for GstDiscovererInfo structs
  * tracker-extract: gif: Fixed memory leak on error for filename
  * functional-tests: Set up XDG data and cache directories like we do in utils/sandbox/
  * functional-tests: Avoid invalid calls to g_source_remove(), avoids: "GLib-CRITICAL **: Source ID 130 was not found when attempting to remove it"
  * utils/sandbox/tracker-sandbox: Use separate dirs for config and data because there may be file name conflicts
  * docs/tools/ttl2sgml: Don't GError on nao:deprecated namespaces in the ontology, errors for mlo which is entirely deprecated

NEW in 0.15.2 - 2013-02-11
==========================

The changes are:

  * Build: Required SQLite 3.7.9 (was 3.7.0) for FTS4 support
  * New Feature: Full Text Search (FTS) v4 support:
                 New SPARQL function fts:snippet(?u)
                 - Snippets provide context around a matched query.
                 New SPARQL function fts:offsets(?u):
                 - Offsets provide an index where a matched query is found in context
                   See tracker-needle for basic use.

Translations:

  * None

Notes:

  The database version has been incremented, this will force a
  reindex for any existing Tracker installation.

  Due to the deprecation of tracker:fulltextNoLimit and removal of
  libtracker-fts's config option to set the minimum word length, we
  now index ALL small words and rely on stop words to filter
  redundant data. We still have the maximum word length checks in
  place.

Translations:

  Many, thank you to everyone involved.

Notes:

  The database version has been incremented, this will force a
  reindex for any existing Tracker installation.

  Existing configurations should have migration paths to new GSettings
  based format.

  Of all the requirement changes listed above, the only GSettings and
  GObject Introspection are absolutely required to build Tracker, the
  others are optional depending on components being built. These are
  also only when building from git, not a distributed tarball (which
  should have the m4 macros packaged).

    just static at 1000.

  tracker-search-tool:

  * Improved so the progress bar is not displayed for miners not
    running.
  * Fixed so the default progress is 100% (in cases where the
    tracker-status-icon is restarted).

  tracker-search-tool:
  * Fixed UI to be more HIG compliant.

Notes:

  The Deskbar applet packaged with Tracker is currently out of date
  and needs some love to get it working with the new APIs. It is in
  the same state as it was for 0.6. As such it isn't expected to work.


NEW in 0.7.2
============

Improvements / New:

  General:
  * Added support for AM_SILENT_RULES (used for producing nice build
    output), see http://live.gnome.org/GnomeGoals/NicerBuilds
  * Removed filters/ - they are no longer used, was for full text
    search abilities. We now do this in tracker-extract.
  * Simplify CFLAGS/LIBS for applications and generally all Makefiles.

  Ontology:
  * Added average{audio|video}bitrate for nmm:Video. This allows the
    audio and video to have different bit rates in the same URN.
  * Added properties for newly added MTP.
  * Added properties fourCC and waveformat for MTP.
  * Added properties to NMM to support MTP (nmm:lyrics,
    mmm:skipCounter, nmm:isCropped, nmm:isColorCorrected).
  * Added nmm and mto prefixes.
  * Updated mtp:ScanType to subclass nie:InformationElement allowing
    nie:description on instances.
  * Renamed nmm:album to nmm:videoAlbum to be consistent with
    nmm:audioAlbum.

  Test Cases:

  libstemmer:
  * Fix API to return const/non-const more consistently.

  libtracker-common:
  * Fixed TrackerConfigFile to make it an abstract type object.
  * Fixed storage (HAL) APIs to return const/non-const more
    consistently.
  * Fixed tracker_path_evaluate_name() so we use the HOME environment
    variable with g_getenv() instead of g_get_home_dir(). This fixes
    issues seen with NFS mounted home directories.
  * Fixed storage (HAL) APIs to normalise directories returned.
  * Fixed timezone test case for tracker-type-utils.
  * Improve documentation.

  libtracker-data:
  * Fixed virtual property tracker:uri.

  libtracker-miner:
  * Added "process-pool-limit" to TrackerMinerFS, this allows us to
    process more than one file at once. Previously each file was
    extracted in tracker-extract and stored in tracker-store
    sequentially. Now data is extracted while it is being stored if
    process-pool-limit is > 1. Now it is set to 10.
  * Added support for deleting recursively when a directory is removed.
  * Updated the documentation.
  * Removed "application" parameter in tracker_miner_pause(), since
    it now uses g_get_application_name() or TrackerMiner::name
    internally.
  * Update vtable function process_file() for TrackerMinerFS into a
    signal to be consistent with the rest of the API.
  * Fixed pkg-config file to include dbus-glib.
  * Fixed moving items between two monitored directories. Was unsupported.
  * Fixed g_timer_destroy() warning with timer != NULL.

  tracker-store:
  * Updated the Dia documentation for trackerd to detail how
    tracker-store works.
  * Updated SQL generated for FTS queries by SPARQL.
  * Added support for function calls as select expressions in SPARQL.
  * Added support dots at the end of simple OPTIONAL statements in
    SPARQL.

  tracker-miner-fs:
  * Fixed crawling duplicate directories if one is in the config file
    and the other is a removable media.
  * Fixed memory leak with returned removable devices from storage (HAL).
  * Updated the Dia documentation for tracker-indexer to detail how
    tracker-miner-fs works.
  * Fixed so we don't print "miners all finished" more than once.

  tracker-extract:
  * Added tracker_text_normalize() to clean up content used for FTS.
    This function effectively strips non-text characters, extra spaces,
    carriage returns, etc.
  * Added FTS support for MS and ODF document formats.
  * Fixed PDF extractor to use tracker_text_normalize().

  tracker-tag:
  * Added support for removing a tag on a per URN basis instead of
    for all content.
  * Fixed return value

Bugs:

  * Fixes GB#570608 - Translation of firefox-extension
  * Fixes GB#592400 - String translation issues
  * Fixes GB#589059 - Add option to set evolution plugins directory in configure
  * Fixes GB#591814 - Clean up .ui files
  * Fixes GB#581984 - Get rid of deprecated libgnome(ui)
  * Fixes GB#595752 - Minor string fixes
  * Fixes NB#142257 - Query from QtTracker causes error

Notes:

  The Deskbar applet packaged with Tracker is currently out of date
  and needs some love to get it working with the new APIs. It is in
  the same state as it was for 0.6. As such it isn't expected to work.


NEW in 0.7.1
============

Improvements / New:

  General:
  * Updated version of dbus and dbus-glib and removed
    SUBJECT_TO_CHANGE use everywhere.
  * Updated version of libxml to something realistic.
  * Updated version of libgee to 0.3.
  * Updated vala requirement suggestion in autogen.sh to 0.7.6.

  Ontology:
  * Added prefix "mlo" for http://www.tracker-project.org/temp/mlo
  * Updated scal ontology to cover ical standard.

  Documentation:
  * Added initial documentation for libtracker-miner.
  * Fixed typo in tracker-processes man page.
  * Fixed warnings when building documenation for libtracker-common
  * Regenerated documentation sections for libtracker-common

  libtracker-common:
  * Fixed memory leak in tracker_string_to_date().
  * Moved TrackerParser API to libtracker-fts, only used there.

  libtracker-db:
  * Updated headers so only one header can be included if used externally

  libtracker-data:
  * Added support for fn:contains and fn:ends-with for SPARQL.
  * Removed unnecessary FTS INSERT and DELETE statements.
  * Updated to avoid unnecessary SQL CAST expressions.

  libtracker-fts:
  * Added to unit tests
  * Removed broken and unused paragraph detection.
  * Moved this from "tracker-fts" everywhere in code base since it is
    a library not an application.

  libtracker-miner:
  * Added get_status() and is_paused() APIs.
  * Removed GetName and GetDescription DBus methods, now in desktop
    files and exposed through TrackerMinerManager API.

  tracker-store:
  * Clean up queued batch updates to the database when clients
    disconnect.
  * Do not use JOIN for simple OPTIONAL patterns in SPARQL
    (significant speed improvement).

  tracker-miner-fs:
  * Added support back for thumbnailing.
  * Added support for full paths in config for IgnoredFiles and
    IgnoredDirectories.
  * Added support for XDG spec. for special user directories. So now
    in the config, IndexRecursiveDirectories and
    IndexSingleDirectories can include "&DOCUMENTS", or "&MUSIC", etc.
    The list of special locations is listed in the config and
    documented. This falls back to $HOME when not available for some
    distributions.
  * Removed unused files.
  * Updated the default indexed locations to DESKTOP, DOCUMENTS,
    DOWNLOADS, MUSIC, PICTURES and VIDEOS as per the XDG spec (this
    was $HOME).
  * Fixed trying to send thumbnail queues of size 0.
  * Fixed trying to send thumbnails when service is not available.
  * Fixed double unref in thumbnailer code.
  * Fixed 2 memory leaks found while valgrinding.

  tracker-extract:
  * Fixed assertion in HAL is NULL from starting on the command line.
  * Fixed Ctrl+C not working with -d.

  tracker-status:
  * Use libtracker-miner APIs instead of DBus calls.
  * Use libtracker-miner API to get display names (translatable).

  tracker-search-bar:
  * Fixed crash when clicking on the results window with the "no
    results found..." message.

  tracker-search-tool:
  * Added smart wildcards when last character is not a space.
  * Fixed category selector.
  * Fixed crasher when selecting categories.

Bugs:

  * Fixes NB#141309, Remove nco:hasPostalAddress cardinality limitation
  * Fixes NB#132655, Tracker-import error handling jams
  * Fixes GB#595976, Message 'SQL logic error or missing database'
  * Fixes GB#592400, String translation issues
  * Fixes GB#595752, Minor string fixes

Notes:

  The Deskbar applet packaged with Tracker is currently out of date
  and needs some love to get it working with the new APIs. It is in
  the same state as it was for 0.6. As such it isn't expected to work.


NEW in 0.7
==========

Improvements / New:

  * Library: libtracker-miner
    A common library for data miners to use allowing easy integration
    with Tracker. This provides D-Bus integration, state and progress
    APIs and a means to pause / resume your miner.

  * Library: libtracker-client
    This API has been completely changed. It is much simpler now and
    relies more on the SPARQL language than specific APIs to query
    Tracker.

  * Daemon: tracker-store
    Completely reworked to accept SPARQL queries and updates.
    Implements Nepomuk ontology instead of flawed own brand. This
    ontology is implemented following the W3C RDF semantics.

  * Database: Completely redesigned ALL databases.
    These now support triple store and allow much faster querying.

  * Application: tracker-miner-fs
    Implements libtracker-miner and facilitates the old roles of
    tracker-indexer and some of the old roles from trackerd like file
    system crawling. This mines data and sends it to tracker-store to
    put in the database about files AND applications.

  * Application: tracker-sparql
    A command line tool to query or update the databases using SPARQL.

  * Application: tracker-import
    A command line tool to import data kept in Turtle files.

  * Application: tracker-search-bar
    An applet for quickly searching for music, videos, images,
    documents and folders.

  * Application: tracker-status-icon
    Previously tracker-applet, but rewritten and now much simpler.
    This provides state and progress information about all miners
    which are running. This also allows the user to pause / resume
    data miners.

  * Application: tracker-search-tool
    This has been completely rewritten using vala and the new
    architecture underneath it. Support for the old features are not
    quite there yet, but it is similar to its predecessor!

  * Application: tracker-explore
    This is an application written to explore data in the database and
    each item's relationship to the next. This really demonstrates
    Tracker's ontology and provides it through full text searching.

  * Plugin: Evolution
    Now the evolution plugin is supported by the developers instead of
    us dipping into their databases (as previously) which is dangerous
    and unsafe. Also this implements the libtracker-miner API so it
    can be controlled using tracker-status-icon.

  * Patches: Nautilus & GtkFileChooser
    These are currently submitted upstream to support the new APIs for
    continued integration between Tracker and GNOME.

Bugs:

  Too many to list here and so much development some are even obsolete.

Notes:

  There is currently no migration path from 0.6. to 0.7. So all
  configurations will have to be re-set up for now. This is planned to
  be added before a 0.8 release.

  Man pages have all been revamped providing information about all new
  commands too.

NEW in 0.6.90:
==============

Features:
- Major re-factoring over the last 12 months for cleaner code.
- Modular approach with:
  - libtracker-common
    (common functions shared across all binaries)
  - libtracker-db
    (database abstraction and manipulation API)
  - libtracker-data
    (a higher level data get/set API)
  - libtracker-module
    (an API used by 3rd parties to index their content)
- DBus re-factoring and use of GLib bindings (for maintainability).
  (The method names haven't changed, but the objects have, so the
  client applications will need to be updated).
- Extractors are now run as an external process detached from the
  indexer to not crash the indexer for problematic files.
- The utility applications have all been improved and use GOption
  for argument parsing.
- Configuration is now more centralised and used by applications as
  well as the daemon/indexer.
- File monitoring has been rewritten using GIO and libinotify:
- GnomeVFS support dropped from the project.
- Requirement for GLib 2.16.x.
- Imported libinotify (for use in the daemon for file monitoring).
  (due to lack of MOVE event information from GIO).
- Support for DBus introspection.
- Support for removable media indexing (MMC, USB sticks).
- Support for meta-data caching on removable devices
  (see http://live.gnome.org/MetadataOnRemovableDevices)
- Support for searching with OR operations.
- Support for XESAM (initial support only).
- Added application dedicated to indexing (tracker-indexer).
- Added estimated time remaining while indexing.
- Added module API and framework for applications to add support for
  their media files to be indexed.
- Added utility applications:
  - tracker-unique
    (searches for unique values with option RDF filters)
  - tracker-services
    (lists all ontology services/properties)
  - tracker-info
    (lists details known to tracker about a particular file)
- Added unit tests for:
  - trackerd
  - tracker-indexer
  - tracker-extract
  - libtracker-common
  - libtracker-db
- Added documentation for:
  - daemon/indexer design
  - libtracker-common
  - libtracker-module

Missing Support:
- Index merging has been removed in this release due to lack of
  time to implementing it and with plans to redesign. SQLite FTS has
  the feature internally and will be used in future releases. This
  is noticeable only for very large data sets where a slowdown can be
  observed.

Bugs:

Tracker 0.6.6
============= (03 Mar 2008)

  Applet
  * HIG fix for preference window.
  * Progress for index merges added.

  Tracker daemon
  * Fixed shutdown of daemon when paused to prevent hangs.
  * Fixed an unfinished final index merge step when next restarted.



Tracker 0.6.5
============= (27 Feb 2008)

  Applet
  * Removed popup window and replaced with tooltip displaying status
    and progress.
  * New Applet preferences to turn off animation/hide icon/set
    smart pause.
  * Smart pause feature which can auto-pause the Tracker daemon
    whenever the user presses a key or moves the mouse, thereby
    improving system responsiveness during indexing.
  * Annoying merge messages have now been removed.
  * Reindex option added.
  * About box added.
  * Now hidden if indexing is disabled.
  * Bugs with constant animation fixed.
  * Animation rate slowed right down so as to be less annoying.

  Tracker daemon
  * Temporary blacklisting of frequently changing files (they are
    indexed after one hour or on next restart of Tracker daemon).
    This prevents constant indexing from downloads and torrents.
  * More blacklisting of common tmp formats and vmware files.
  * Memory leak fixes.
  * Removed CPU-heavy corruption scan which can last long time and
    occurs on battery too at startup when tracker daemon was not
    previously shut down properly. Instead we now use bigger
    transactions with fsync on to prevent corruption in the first
    place (only slightly more disk IO is used during indexing as a
    result).
  * Fixed crashers.
  * Fixed D-Bus shutdown/reindex call.



Tracker 0.6.4
============= (11 Dec 2007)

  * Made indexing more robust by pausing if disk space is low or
    index grows too big.
  * Limit log file size to 10MB.
  * New Tracker Applet - animates when indexing, provides ability to
    pause indexing as well as viewing status and progress feedback
    from indexer, statistics, and notification warnings; it can
    also launch Tracker Preferences and Tracker Search Tool.
  * New power management options enable much better customization.
  * Ignored files fixes.
  * Deskbar/tracker integration fixes.
  * Made most prefs live and affect Tracker in real time; others
    will prompt for restart and/or reindex where necessary.
  * Shell script fixes
  * Fixed Imap bug with embedded Auth in URI.
  * Built-in corruption check and scan when Tracker is not shut down
    cleanly - prevents infinite looping.
  * Fix index deletions.
  * Many more bug fixes and stability improvements.



Tracker 0.6.3
============= (25 Sep 2007)

  * Fixed memory leaks.
  * New index merging which allows for much better performance and
    much less disk hogging I/O.
  * Battery throttling - Tracker now stops indexing when on battery.
  * Many more optimisations - transactions, use of O_NOATIME and
    posix_fadvise everywhere.
  * Check files exist before including in search results.
  * Fixed disabling of indexing option in tracker-preferences.
  * HIG fixes to tracker-preferences screen.
  * Fixed resetting of stats.

  note:
    This version will cause your hard drive to be re-indexed so
    that stats are fixed (previous version broke them).



Tracker 0.6.2
============= (25 Sep 2007)

  * New Sqlite-based indexer which utilises the new incremental blob
    I/O in sqlite 3.4.
  * Highly-optimised email indexing (up to 5x faster).
  * Dramatically reduced disk access and disk contention.
  * Indexer now pauses for a grace period when non-Tracker processes
    write to disk (providing changed files are being watched by
    Tracker) - minimises slowdowns when compiling or checking out
    source code.
  * Makes use of idle class disk IO scheduling if available.
  * Makes preliminary use of NO_ATIME (some disk access still uses
    fopen).
  * Fixed restore of user metadata on re-index (keywords are
    auto-restored).
  * Added increased number of (junk) files to automatically ignore.
  * Improved stopwords.
  * New Deskbar handler that uses the new Deskbar api (2.19+).
  * Fixed old Deskbar handler to remove race condition causing
    crashes.
  * Fixed a number of annoying bugs in email indexing and Tracker
    Preferences.

  note:
    This version will cause your hard drive to be re-indexed due to
    the new Sqlite indexer backend.


Tracker 0.6.1
============= (08 Aug 2007)

  * translations and bugfixes


Tracker 0.6.0 "better late than never"
============= (24 Jul 2007)

  * Evolution Emails (mbox/pop/imap) now indexed.
  * Gaim/Pidgin chat logs now indexed.
  * Applications now indexed.
  * New files indexed - all spreadsheets, csv (these require
    Gnumeric to be installed) and oo draw.
  * Vastly improved and new search UI using a sidebar for categories
    and a new metadata tile.
  * Tagging support in the UI.
  * New tracker-preferences UI for easy setting of prefs.
  * Added libtracker-gtk widget toolkit.
  * Now uses XDG directories.
  * Optimised triple store.
  * Handles multiple triple stores (files, emails and user data are
    all separate dbs).
  * New IDF based ranking algorithm.
  * XMP metadata support added.
  * Made use of async calls in tracker-search-tool to prevent it
    from freezing.
  * Added a 60 second delay before indexing to prevent slowdowns on
    desktop start-up.
  * Added support for crawling directories without watching overhead
    (useful for indexing source code without causing slowdowns when
     compiling).


Tracker 0.5.4 "Speed Daemon"
============= (26 Jan 2007)

  * Indexing at ludicrous speed - massively optimised indexing so
    its now 10x faster than previous version. Indexing speeds are
    now around 100 text files per second (which is about the
    maximum possible considering the I/O time to read 100 files from
    a hard drive).
  * Index while you work - now scheduled even better so it should
    never slow the system down whilst allowing users to work without
    being affected by or even noticing it.
  * Also provides additional --throttle command line parameter to
    customise throttling even further so no need to endure noisy
    fans or hot laptops while indexing.
  * New verbosity param to control how much data is shown on screen
    and in log.
  * Fixed MPlayer backend which is now used if gstreamer backend
    returns no metadata
  * Improved reaping of all spawned apps - no more zombies!
  * Improved mime and text file detection.
  * Added improved deskbar-handler.
  * Got Tracker to run nicely on FUSE based filesystems.


Tracker 0.5.3
============= (24 Dec 2006)

  * Fixed memory leaks when indexing (typical mem usage should now
    be ~6MB RSS when indexing large numbers of files).
  * New improved metadata engine now sports multiple values per
    metadata item and rdf style recursive metadata relationships.
  * Support for Dublin Core types (especially for metadata
    relationships).
  * Changed command line options for trackerd to be similiar to
    other programs.
  * Metadata names now to reflect rdf style syntax (Eg DC:Keywords).
  * Improved indexing of numeric data so that only meaningful
    numbers are indexed (IE must contain 5 or more consecutive
    numbers to be indexable).
  * Improved indexing of filenames so that hyphens and underscores
    are used as word breaks to create a delimited filename in
    addition to the full filename.
  * Improved snippet generator to start/end on a word break if
    possible.


Tracker 0.5.2
============= (21 Nov 2006)

  * Now has l10n/i18n support.
  * Added timeout to all external processes and metadata extractors
    used by Tracker.
  * Added missing OpenOffice templates to our filters.
  * Fixed filters to use different packages like w3m for indexing
    html.
  * Fixed Debian build and added new packages for data files and
    translations.
  * Imporved t-s-t and made snippets wordwrap, made snippets async,
    used Tracker's mime facility, improved highlighting and fixed
    crasher.
  * Limited tracker-extract's memory usage using setrlimit.
  * Added desktop files for tracker-search-tool.


Tracker 0.5.1
============= (07 Nov 2006)

  * Inlined a threadsafe version of sqlite to prevent common errors
    like content not being indexed. This can be overriden for those
    with a threadsafe version of SQlite.
  * New Gstreamer-based audio/video extractor on by default.
  * Made extractors more robust.
  * Fixed a number of compiler warnings.
  * Tidied up the tracker-search-tool to have buttons more evenly-sized
  * Fixed a few leaks and made the D-Bus interface more robust.
  * Imporved IOprio detection.


Tracker 0.5.0
============= (25 Oct 2006)

  * Completely new backend that has been moved from Mysql to the
    nimble Sqlite database and QDBM inverted word index.
  * New tracker-search-tool GUI which allows you to search for your
    files in a google-like fashion with results depicted with
    google-style search snippets.
  * Revamped Rdf Query engine.
  * New lighter design with big dependencies like libextractor
    having been dropped in favour of lighter and optional metadata
    extractors.
  * Added new extractors that can use Totem or MPlayer.
  * New options to tune Tracker for your system. We now have a
    --enable-low-memory setting for use with computers with less
    RAM and a --turbo mode for those  who want indexing to take
    place as fast as possible.
  * New snowball stemmers have been integrated into Tracker to
    provide some of the highest quality open source stemming around.
  * New language-specific stopword lists to prevent indexng of
    common words (which are of little value).
  * Can optionally make use of Pango word breaking for full
    internationalisation support.


Tracker 0.0.4 "Now indexing at Warp speed"
============= (16 May 2006)

  * Hugely optimised indexing when many files are waiting to be
    indexed (especially when you first run trackerd).
  * Mass queueing of files no longer blocks the main thread, meaning
    super fast searches can still be performed during heavy indexing.
  * Eliminated CPU bottlenecks and improved thread synchronisations
    so Tracker now hits the ground running when indexing (approx
    500+ files indexed per minute on inotify-enabled systems).
  * Extended metadata support for more Exif fields.
  * Added more service types.
  * Imporved build and support for FC5 (includes RPMs).
  * Redesigned Database around version 5 of the *embedded*
    in-process MySQL database library.
  * Now uses the auto-repair facility provided by MySQL to
    automatically repair damaged database files so you need never
    worry about losing your precious data.
  * Moved virtually all DB logic into stored procedures which
    provides a clean seperation of DB logic and application logic.
  * Added support for parsing dates in various formats including
    conversion to/from ISO 8601 format
  * Fixed MSWord filter to prevent looping (WvText causes inotify to
    report file write change causing endless looping).
  * Redesigned DB structure to be more generic and service orientated
  * Added support for service types (first class objects) to DB.
  * Cleaned up code warnings and fixed potential crasher.
  * Fixed issues with argv handling.
  * Fixed build issue for Fedora Core 5.


Tracker 0.0.3
============= (29 Mar 2006)

  * Made D-Bus interface more generic
  * Corrected search results of hyphenated search terms.
  * Added support for limiting no. of hits for searches.
  * Added optional support for sorting search results by relevance
    score.
  * A few minor bug fixes (Updating file name metadata correctly
    during move, correcting use of hyphenated search terms).
  * Streamlined the inlined version of libextractor and improved
    build system and fixed bug in previous version which prevented
    compilation of the inlined version.


Tracker 0.0.2
============= (27 Feb 2006)

  * Full inotify support (only compatible with Linux kernels 2.6.13
    or higher) with optimisations for detected moves.
  * Fallback to FAM/GAMIN and manual polling for non-Linux and/or
    non-inotify systems.
  * Improved build system which allows you to specify which file
    monitoring backend to use.
  * Valgrind'ed to remove all leaks.


16 Jan 2006
  *	Added support for Tracker as a Nautilus Search Backend.


05 Jan 2006
  * Added polling mechanism to watch files in absence of FAM/iNotify
	or when FAM/iNotify watch limits have been exceeded.
