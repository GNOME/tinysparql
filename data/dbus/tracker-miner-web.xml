            Returns a hash containing the information necessary to know how to
            associate the miner to its web service. Association is the action
            of "binding" the miner and the web service, that is asking user
            approval to be granted the right to access the data.
            A miner must be associated before being able to download data.

            <doc:para>
              A hash containing the association information. Its keys depend on
              the type of association.
              For a token based association, the following keys are always
              defined:
              * url: A url where the user can follow the association procedure.
                     The page at this URL generally checks the user's
                     credentials, and asks him to approve the service.
                     When the user is done with the procedure, he has to notify
                     the miner manager, which will then call the Associate
                     method.
              For a token based association, the following keys might be
              defined:
              * post_message: A message to display after he returns from the
                              association procedure
              * post_url: A url to point the user to after he returns from the
                          association procedure
              If both post_message and post_url are defined, the message will
              shown to the user before he is pointer to post_url.
              For a user/pass based based association, the hash table should be
              empty, real association is done using the Associate method.

            Associates the miner with its web service using the provided
            association data. After this step (if successful), the miner
            should be able to access the online data.

            <doc:para>
              A hash containing the association information. Its keys depend on
              the type of association.
              For a token based association, the hash should be empty. The miner
              should get the definitive token from the remote web service, and
              store it using the password provider.
              For a user/pass based based association, the following keys
              should be defined:
              * username: The username provided by the user
              * password: The password provided by the user
              In the case of a user/pass association, the miner should use the
              provided credentials to check the login against the remote web
              service, and store them if successful.

            Dissociates the miner from its web service. When called, the miner
            should delete any credentials it has guarded using the password
            provider, and if possible revoke the authorization from the remote
            service.
