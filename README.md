    (*tracker-store*), the database ontologies, the commandline user
    interface (`tracker`), and several support libraries.

    the indexer daemon (*tracker-miner-fs*) and tools to extract metadata
    from many different filetypes.

## Compilation

To setup the project for compilation after checking it out from
the git repository, use:

        meson build --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

To start compiling the project use:

        ninja -C build
        ninja install

If you install using any other prefix, you might have problems
with files not being installed correctly. (You may need to copy
and amend the dbus service file to the correct directory and/or
might need to update ld_conf if you install into non-standard
directories.)
