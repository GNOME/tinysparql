 * @title: TrackerSparqlStatement
 * @stability: Stable
 * @include: tracker-sparql.h
 *
 * The <structname>TrackerSparqlStatement</structname> object represents
 * a SPARQL query. This query may contain parameterized variables
 * (expressed as ~var in the syntax), which may be mapped to arbitrary
 * values prior to execution. This statement may be reused for future
 * queries with different values.
 *
 * The argument bindings may be changed through tracker_sparql_statement_bind_int(),
 * tracker_sparql_statement_bind_boolean(), tracker_sparql_statement_bind_double()
 * and tracker_sparql_statement_bind_string(). Those functions receive
 * a @name argument corresponding for the variable name in the SPARQL query
 * (eg. "var" for ~var) and a @value to map the variable to.
 *
 * Once all arguments have a value, the query may be executed through
 * tracker_sparql_statement_execute() or tracker_sparql_statement_execute_async().
 *
 * This object was added in Tracker 2.2.
