/**
 * TrackerSparqlConnection:
 *
 * `TrackerSparqlConnection` holds a connection to a RDF triple store.
 *
 * This triple store may be of three types:
 *
 *  - Local to the process, created through [ctor@SparqlConnection.new].
 *  - A HTTP SPARQL endpoint over the network, created through
 *    [ctor@SparqlConnection.remote_new]
 *  - A DBus SPARQL endpoint owned by another process in the same machine, created
 *    through [ctor@SparqlConnection.bus_new]
 *
 * When creating a local triple store, it is required to give details about its
 * structure. This is done by passing a location to an ontology, see more
 * on how are [ontologies defined](ontologies.html). A local database may be
 * stored in a filesystem location, or it may reside in memory.
 *
 * A `TrackerSparqlConnection` is private to the calling process, it can be
 * exposed to other hosts/processes via a [class@Endpoint], see
 * [ctor@EndpointDBus.new] and [ctor@EndpointHttp.new].
 *
 * When issuing SPARQL queries and updates, it is recommended that these are
 * created through [class@SparqlStatement] to avoid the SPARQL
 * injection class of bugs, see [method@SparqlConnection.query_statement]
 * and [method@SparqlConnection.update_statement]. For SPARQL updates
 * it is also possible to use a "builder" approach to generate RDF data, see
 * [class@Resource]. It is also possible to create [class@SparqlStatement]
 * objects for SPARQL queries and updates from SPARQL strings embedded in a
 * [struct@Gio.Resource], see [method@SparqlConnection.load_statement_from_gresource].
 *
 * To get the best performance, it is recommended that SPARQL updates are clustered
 * through [class@Batch].
 *
 * `TrackerSparqlConnection` also offers a number of methods for the simple cases,
 * [method@SparqlConnection.query] may be used when there is a SPARQL
 * query string directly available, and the [method@SparqlConnection.update]
 * family of functions may be used for one-off updates. All functions have asynchronous
 * variants.
 *
 * When a SPARQL query is executed, a [class@SparqlCursor] will be obtained
 * to iterate over the query results.
 *
 * Depending on the ontology definition, `TrackerSparqlConnection` may emit
 * notifications whenever resources of certain types get insert, modified or
 * deleted from the triple store (see [nrl:notify](nrl-ontology.html#nrl:notify).
 * These notifications can be handled via a [class@Notifier] obtained with
 * [method@SparqlConnection.create_notifier].
 *
 * After done with a connection, it is recommended to call [method@SparqlConnection.close]
 * or [method@SparqlConnection.close_async] explicitly to cleanly close the
 * connection and prevent consistency checks on future runs. The triple store
 * connection will be implicitly closed when the `TrackerSparqlConnection` object
 * is disposed.
 *
 * A `TrackerSparqlConnection` may be used from multiple threads, asynchronous
 * updates are executed sequentially on arrival order, asynchronous
 * queries are dispatched in a thread pool.
 *
 * If you ever have the need to procedurally compose SPARQL query strings, consider
 * the use of [func@sparql_escape_string] for literal strings and
 * the [func@sparql_escape_uri] family of functions for URIs.

 * @connection: A `TrackerSparqlConnection`
 * @sparql: String containing the SPARQL update query
 * @cancellable: (nullable): Optional [type@Gio.Cancellable]
 * @error: Error location
 *
 * Executes a SPARQL update and returns the names of the generated blank nodes.
 *
 * This method is synchronous and will block until the update
 * is finished. See [method@SparqlConnection.update_blank_async]
 * for an asynchronous variant.
 *
 * The @sparql query should be built with [class@Resource], or
 * its parts correctly escaped using [func@sparql_escape_string],
 * otherwise SPARQL injection is possible.
 *
 * The format string of the `GVariant` is `aaa{ss}` (an array of an array
 * of dictionaries). The first array represents each INSERT that may exist in
 * the SPARQL string. The second array represents each new node for a given
 * WHERE clause. The last array holds a string pair with the blank node name
 * (e.g. `foo` for the blank node `_:foo`) and the URN that was generated for
 * it. For most updates the first two outer arrays will only contain one item.
 *
 * Returns: a [type@GLib.Variant] with the generated URNs.
 *
 * Deprecated: 3.5: This function makes the expectation that blank nodes have
 * a durable name that persist. The SPARQL and RDF specs define a much more
 * reduced scope for blank node labels. This function advises a behavior that
 * goes against that reduced scope, and will directly make the returned values
 * meaningless if the #TRACKER_SPARQL_CONNECTION_FLAGS_ANONYMOUS_BNODES flag
 * is defined in the connection.
 *
 * Users that want names generated for them, should look for other methods
 * (e.g. IRIs containing UUIDv4 strings).

 *
 * If @store is %NULL, the database will be created in memory.
 *
 * If defined, the @ontology argument must point to a location containing
 * suitable `.ontology` files in Turtle format. These define the structure of
 * the triple store. You can learn more about [ontologies](ontologies.html),
 * or you can use the stock Nepomuk ontologies by calling
 * [func@sparql_get_ontology_nepomuk].
 *
 * If opening an existing database, it is possible to pass %NULL as the

 * If a database is opened without the #TRACKER_SPARQL_CONNECTION_FLAG_READONLY

 * data layout, migration to the new structure will be attempted. This operation
 * may raise an error. In particular, not all migrations are possible without
 * causing data loss and Tracker will refuse to delete data during a migration.
 * The database is always left in a consistent state, either prior or posterior
 * to migration.
 *
 * Operations on a [class@SparqlConnection] resulting on a
 * [error@SparqlError.CORRUPT] error will have the event recorded
 * persistently through a `.meta.corrupted` file alongside the database files.
 * If the database is opened without the [flags@SparqlConnectionFlags.READONLY]
 * flag and the file is found, this constructor will attempt to repair the
 * database. In that situation, this constructor will either return a valid
 * [class@SparqlConnection] if the database was repaired successfully, or
 * raise a [error@SparqlError.CORRUPT] error if the database remains
 * corrupted.
 *
 * It is considered a developer error to ship ontologies that contain format
 * errors, or that fail at migrations.
 *
 * It is encouraged to use `resource:///` URI locations for @ontology wherever
 * possible, so the triple store structure is tied to the executable binary,
 * and in order to minimize disk seeks during `TrackerSparqlConnection`
 * initialization.
