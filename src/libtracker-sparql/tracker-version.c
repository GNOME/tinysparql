 * tracker_check_version:
 * @required_major: the required major version.
 * @required_minor: the required minor version.
 * @required_micro: the required micro version.
 *
 * Checks that the Tracker library in use is compatible with the
 * given version. Generally you would pass in the constants
 * #TRACKER_MAJOR_VERSION, #TRACKER_MINOR_VERSION, #TRACKER_MICRO_VERSION
 * as the three arguments to this function; that produces
 * a check that the library in use is compatible with
 * the version of Tracker the application or module was compiled
 * against.
 *
 * Compatibility is defined by two things: first the version
 * of the running library is newer than the version
 * @required_major.required_minor.@required_micro. Second
 * the running library must be binary compatible with the
 * version @required_major.required_minor.@required_micro
 * (same major version.)
 *
 * Return value: %NULL if the Tracker library is compatible with the
 *   given version, or a string describing the version mismatch.
 *   The returned string is owned by Tracker and must not be modified
 *   or freed.
